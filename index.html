			<p>Hello,I am Hayelom. I was born in Ethiopia moved to the state eight years ago. Since I was a kid I was interested about computers. Computers first appeared in my life when I was sixteen years old for a class called Information communication Technology. The first computer that I saw was HP Compaq Presario desktop computer.Since that time I have been wondering what is inside the computer that let them to do all the powerful things they do. 
			</p>
			<p>I enjoy watching and playing many sports especially soccer.I love soccer because it is very competitive and tactical sport.I grow up watching English premier league and Spanish la Liga. Once I was a super fun of English club called Manchester United and it's best player Christiano Ronaldo.</p>
