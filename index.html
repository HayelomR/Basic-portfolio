<h1>About me</h1>
<section id="content">
	<p>Hello, my name is Hayelom Reda. I was born in Ethiopia. I came to the United States eight years ago. Since I was a kid I was interested in two things chemistry and computer. I have studied chemistry from 2012 to 2014 on Metrostate University of Denver and Community College of Denver. Computers first appeared in my life when I was sixteen years old. for a class called Information communication Technology. The first computer that I saw was HP Compaq Presario desktop computer. Since that time I have been interested to know more about computers. </p>
	<p>I enjoy watching and playing many sports especially soccer. I love soccer because it is very competitive and tactical. I grow up watching English premier league and Spanish la Liga.  Once I was a super fun of English club called Manchester United and one of it's best players Christiano Ronaldo.</p>
