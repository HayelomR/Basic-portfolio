<h1>Hayelom Reda</h1>
<p>Hello,my name is Hayelom Reda. I was born in Ethiopia. I came to United States eight years a go. Since I was a kidy I was intersted on two things chemistry and computer. I have stusdied chemistry from 2012 to 2014 on Metrostate Univeristy of Denver and Community College of Denver. Computers first appered in my life when I was 16 years old while I was grade 11. Then me and my classmates meet saw the first dekstop computer. It was Commodore 64 and I remember myself thinking, that it was the best thing in the world. I was playing it whenever I could. Then I had got my first PC. At first, I was just playing computer games, but some time later, I noticed that I could do a lot more things with the computer, for example programming. Now, I can already programue in Pascal, C++ and HTML. I have my own site on the internet and I have done many programues. I hope that in the future I will get a job as a computer scientist.</p>
<p>I enjoy watching and playing many sports especially soccer. I love soccer because it is very competitive and tactical. I grow up watching English premier league and Spanish la Liga.  Once I was a super fun of English club called Manchester United and one of it's best players Christiano Ronaldo.</p>
